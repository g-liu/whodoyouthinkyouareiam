Who do you think you are I am!
===============================

This is the source code for my absolutely pointless Chrome extension, named after an infamous quote by the bowler Pete Weber. You can find the actual extension [on the Google Chrome Extensions store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/who-do-you-think-you-are/iijkplkkgkhhfmfhbedibfipppdajlkn).

Installation
============

If you prefer to install from source, clone the repo

    git clone https://github.com/g-liu/whodoyouthinkyouareiam.git

Then, go to `chrome://extensions`. Drag and drop the folder that you just cloned into the Extensions page. Note that you may have to first check "Developer mode" for this to work.
